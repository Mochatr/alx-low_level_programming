# Search Algorithm Project

## Overview
This project is focused on the study and implementation of search algorithms, emphasizing understanding and applying linear and binary search algorithms. The primary goal is to deepen knowledge of search algorithms and their complexities, ensuring the ability to select the most efficient algorithm based on specific needs and data characteristics.

## Resources
- [Search algorithm](https://www.example.com/search_algorithm)
- [Space complexity](https://www.example.com/space_complexity)

## Learning Objectives
Upon completion of this project, participants should be able to explain, without external resources:

- What a search algorithm is.
- How linear search works.
- How binary search operates and its prerequisites.
- The criteria for selecting the most appropriate search algorithm based on data organization and operation requirements.

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`.
- All files must compile on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc` with the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`.
- Every file should end with a new line.
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory.
- Code should adhere to the Betty style and will be checked with `betty-style.pl` and `betty-doc.pl`.
- Global variables are forbidden.
- A maximum of 5 functions per file.
- Only the `printf` function from the standard library is allowed. Calls to functions like `strdup`, `malloc`, etc., are forbidden.
- `main.c` files provided as examples should not be pushed to your repo (if pushed, they won't be considered).
- Compilation and testing will be done with Holberton School's own `main.c` files, which may differ from the provided examples.
- Prototypes of all functions must be included in your header file `search_algos.h`.
- Ensure to push your header file.
- All your header files should be include guarded.

### More Info on Big O Notation
Files containing big O notations should use the following format:
- `O(1)`
- `O(n)`
- `O(n!)`
- `n*m -> O(nm)`
- `n square -> O(n^2)`
- `sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))`
- `log(n) -> O(log(n))`
- `n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))`
- â€¦
